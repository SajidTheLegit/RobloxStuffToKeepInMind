To turn an R15 avatar into R6 without scripting, do the following:

1. Open a baseplate (or anything else) on Roblox Studio. Pretty obvious, but some still don't know.
2. On the top, remain on the 'Home' tab.
3. Click on 'Game Settings'
4. Click on the 'Avatar' tab, which can be found on the left.
5. Then, on 'Avatar Type' and select 'R6'. On default it's set to R15.
6. And from now on, even if a player's avatar is set to R15, it will be displayed as an R6.

That's how you do it.
